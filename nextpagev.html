<font size="+2"><p>Spotify (/ˈspɒtɪfaɪ/; Swedish: [ˈspɔ̂tːɪfaj])
 is a proprietary Swedish audio 
 streaming and media services provider
  founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel 
  Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one 
  of the largest music streaming service
   providers, with over 422 million 
   monthly active users, including 182 
   million paying subscribers, as of 
   March 2022.Spotify is listed 
   (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled 
   holding company, Spotify Technology
    S.A.) on the New York Stock 
    Exchange in the form of American 
    depositary receipts.Spotify offers 
    digital copyright restricted 
    recorded music and podcasts, 
    including more than 82 million 
    songs, from record labels and 
    media companies. As a freemium 
    service, basic features are free 
    with advertisements and limited 
    control, while additional features,
     such as offline listening and
      commercial-free listening, are
       offered via paid subscriptions.
        Spotify is currently available 
        in 180+ countries, as of October
         2021. Users can search for music
          based on artist, album, or genre, 
          and can create, edit, and share
           playlists.<br>


Unlike physical or download sales,
 which pay artists a fixed price per 
 song or album sold, Spotify pays 
 royalties based on the number of 
 artist streams as a proportion of
  total songs streamed. It distributes 
  approximately 70% of its total revenue
   to rights holders (often record labels)
   , who then pay artists based on 
   individual agreements. According to 
   Ben Sisario of The New York Times,
    approximately 13,000 out of seven 
    million artists on Spotify generated
     $50,000 or more in payments in 
     2020.</p></font>

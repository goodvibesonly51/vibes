			<p><div> Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is an online-only action role-playing video game developed by Massive Entertainment and published 
			by Ubisoft. The sequel to Tom Clancy's The Division (2016), it is set in a near-future Washington, D.C. in the aftermath of a genetically 
			engineered virus known as "Green Poison" being released, and follows an agent of the Strategic Homeland Division as they try to 
			rebuild the city. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on March 15, 2019. </div></p>

			<p><div> It received generally favorable reviews from critics, with most noting it as an improvement over the first installment for its 
			setting, gameplay, visuals, combat and soundtrack, though the Endgame content polarised critics. Like its predecessor, it was a 
			commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide despite not meeting expectations at launch. Tom Clancy's The Division 
			Heartland, an upcoming spin-off set within the Division universe, is currently in development. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "gameplay" > Gameplay </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> Played from a third-person perspective, the game is a cover-based third-person shooter with up to four players being able 
			to complete missions together. The game takes place in Washington D.C. seven months after its predecessor, in which a civil war 
			between survivors and villainous bands of marauders breaks out. In the beginning of the game, players create their own Division 
			agent by customizing the character's gender and appearance. In the game, players are equipped with different firearms, including 
			assault rifles, sniper rifles and Submachine guns, and explosives like grenades to defeat enemies. These weapons are classified into 
			different tiers and rarity. High-quality guns are difficult to obtain, but they have better weapon stats and "talents" that further help 
			boost players' performance. The weapon stats include the following 7 domains: Damage, Rounds Per Minute, Magazine Size, Accuracy, 
			Stability, Reload Time, and Damage Drop Off. These weapons can be further customized with different attachments like scopes, iron 
			sights and barrel attachments. The game features a variety of gear and armor. Wearing gear from the same brand gives players a 
			small performance boost. As players complete missions, they gain loot and experience points (XP). With sufficient XP, they level up 
			and gain SHD Tech, a currency to unlock new skills. These skills include deploying gun turrets, shields and combat drones, or 
			gaining access to weapons like seeker mines and chem launchers. Each skill has unique mods that change its functionality. 
			The game introduces new enemy types, including healers and characters that shoot foam at players. Players can request 
			backup during missions, which allows other players to join their sessions. Players can join a clan, which can accommodate up to 
			50 players. The actions of individual members of a clan contribute to clan XP, which can be used to upgrade the clan for additional 
			gameplay benefits.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Washington D.C. is an open world for players to explore. Players can recruit non-playable characters by completing missions 
			and providing supplies to different settlements. Recruiting them unlocks new features, including projects, which are fetch quests that 
			reward players with gear, XP, and blueprints for crafting, which can be accessed in the base of operation, the White House. 
			Upgrading settlements enables their expansion to include more facilities and gives players gameplay benefits such as access to their 
			gear stash or fast travel. Another way to fast travel is to use the safehouses players have discovered. Discovering a safehouse reveals 
			the location of nearby SHD caches, which can be used to unlock new perks that further enhance players' combat performance as well 
			as granting advantages such as XP bonuses. Players can liberate enemies' control points and call civilian reinforcements to assist 
			in battle, participate in world events such as stopping public executions and capturing resource convoys, and searching for different 
			collectibles including comms, relics and artifacts, and Echoes. Players encounter different weapon vendors, which buy trinkets 
			(unusable 'junk' items that players collect), and unwanted gear in exchange for E-credits, the game's currency, which can used 
			to purchase new weapons, crafting and appearances changes. </div></p>

			<p><div> The Division 2 features three Dark Zones, each of which supports up to 12 players. Dark Zones are areas in which players 
			defeat tough enemies for valuable and rare loot, though the loot can be taken by other players. Upon entering a Dark Zone, players' 
			gear become normalized to ensure that all players are in a level playing field. Non-contaminated loot belongs to players once collected, 
			but contaminated loot must first be extracted by a helicopter while players defend the extraction point from AI enemies and other 
			players. When one player breaks into a Dark Zone chest or steals a Dark Zone supply drop, the player and their team will become rogue. 
			Rogue players can attack other players in the same session to steal their loot and gain XP. Once they eliminate another player, 
			they become "disavowed", which alerts other non-rogue players. If the disavowed rogue eliminate more players, they're designated a 
			'Manhunt Rogue'; players who kill the rogue agent will receive a significant bounty. Rogue status can be removed by surviving in the 
			Dark Zone for a period of time or accessing the Thieves' Dens (for rogues) and Manhunt terminals (for Manhunt rogues). The Dark
			Zone has its own progression system, DZ XP, which are earned by killing enemies and rogues, and can be used to unlock perks 
			and gameplay advantages such as a reduced rogue timer. </div></p>

			<p><div> When a player reaches level 30 and finishes the game's campaign, the game-world is divided into 'world tiers', which 
			serve as different chapters and thresholds for further increasing the game's difficulty. Levels are replaced by Gear Score, which is 
			calculated based on the stats, attributes, and talents of all the weapons and armor players have. In the endgame, a new enemy 
			faction named the Black Tusk invades DC via a large hovercraft, and randomly selects three previously completed missions or 
			strongholds as operational targets, which reactivate as 'invaded' locations., which feature tougher enemies and correspondingly 
			better loot. By completing Invaded missions and having sufficient Gear Score, players can liberate a stronghold, which then unlocks 
			the next world tier. Players can encounter 52 bosses, collectively known as the Deck of 52; each boss will drop a collectible card for 
			players to collect once they are defeated. When players reach the endgame, they can unlock more skills by specializing their 
			character to a specific class: the Sharpshooter, the Demolitionist, and the Survivalist. Each specialization has its own signature 
			weapon; a Survivalist with a crossbow, a Sharpshooter with a TAC-50 anti-materiel sniper rifle and a Demolitionist with a M32A1 
			grenade launcher. Players can enter Occupied Dark Zones, in which weapons are no longer normalized, friendly fire is activated, 
			AI enemies become more difficult to kill, and players are no longer notified when other players turn rogue. The game features 
			raids, which can be completed by up to eight players. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "setting" > Setting </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> The Division 2 is set after the events of Tom Clancy's The Division, in a world devastated by Green Poison, a potent smallpox 
			strain engineered and released in New York City by an environmental terrorist. Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in 
			casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of 
			domestic sleeper agents called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or "The Division", to preserve order and continuity of 
			government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are 
			supplemented on the field with an advanced A.I. system called ISAC. </div></p>

			<p><div> By the beginning of The Division 2, most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has 
			descended into lawlessness. The White House is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders and National 
			Guard troops called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. 
			has been carved into territories controlled by three competing factions: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and 
			anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during 
			the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the 
			True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, US Armed Forces, and paramilitary mutineers led by Colonel 
			Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal authoritarianism. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "plot" > Plot </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> Seven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack 
			when ISAC, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's 
			Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow 
			agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's 
			local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny 
			Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country's leadership is either dead or missing and the city is 
			mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with 
			fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network. </div></p>

			<p><div> Ortega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President 
			Ellis may have survived the crash of Air Force One but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find 
			Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and 
			rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that broad spectrum antivirals to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, 
			exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the United 
			States Capitol. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the 
			United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final 
			strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of 
			the factions, with the Outcasts' leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while 
			recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital. </div></p>

			<p><div> As the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced private military company 
			Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing 
			the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs 
			of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusk all along, and that Ellis' 
			predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail 
			on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them 
			out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at Tidal Basin, retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile 
			strike on the White House, although Ellis' location remains unknown. </div></p>

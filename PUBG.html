			<p><div> PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or simply PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle 
			royale game developed and published by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game is based on previous mods that were 
			created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into 
			a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge 
			for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases 
			in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the 
			round. </div></p>

			<p><div> PUBG: Battlegrounds was first released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, 
			with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview 
			program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and 
			iOS, was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was released in 
			April 2020, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions released in November 2020. PUBG: Battlegrounds is the fifth best-selling 
			video game of all time, sold over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles as end of 2021.[1] While the more 
			successful PUGB Mobile's global version has accumulated 1 billion downloads as of March 2021 and grossed over $7.933 billion on 
			mobile devices making it the fourth highest-grossing mobile game, combined with the revenue of PC and console game's $4.568 billion, 
			PUBG: Battlegrounds has a total revenue of $12.5 billion as of April 2022. Also, combined with the 1.12 billion mobile players, PUBG: 
			Battlegrounds has a total player count of 1.2 billion as of August 2021, surpassed Crossfire to be the most-played video game of all 
			time. The main game has been free-to-play since January 2022. </div></p>

			<p><div> PUBG received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new 
			types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was attributed 
			to popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. The 
			game received several Game of the Year nominations, among other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments 
			and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular 
			esport. </div></p>

			<p><div> PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale 
			last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a 
			small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match. Each match starts with players parachuting from a 
			plane onto one of the four maps, which have areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), 
			and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi).<br> 
			The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly 
			determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections 
			which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, 
			vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, 
			with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. Players 
			can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in 
			combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate 
			some advantages. </div></p>

			<p><div> Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught 
			outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, 
			the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. This results in a more confined map, in turn 
			increasing the chances of encounters. During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and 
			bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, 
			giving them time to relocate to safety. A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a 
			player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These 
			packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations. On average, a full 
			round takes no more than 30 minutes. <br> 
			At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase 
			crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization. A rotating "event mode" was added to the game in 
			March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution 
			of weapons and armor across the game map.  </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "development"> Development</h2> </u><hr>

			<p><div> The game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had 
			previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ: Battle Royale, an offshoot of popular mod DayZ, and inspired by the 2000 Japanese film 
			Battle Royale. At the time he created DayZ: Battle Royale, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been living in Brazil for a few years 
			as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played video games such as Delta Force: Black Hawk Down and 
			America's Army. The DayZ mod caught his interest, both as a realistic military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and 
			started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he went along. Greene found most multiplayer first-
			person shooters too repetitive, considering maps small and easy to memorize.   </div></p>

			<p><div> He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect, creating a high 
			degree of replayability; this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and using random item 
			placement across it. Greene was also inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ, which featured a number of 
			Twitch and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left; as he was not a streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a similar 
			game mode that anyone could play. His initial efforts on this mod were more inspired by The Hunger Games novels, where players would 
			try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central location, but moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at survival by 
			spreading weapons around, and also to avoid copyright issues with the novels. In taking inspiration from the Battle Royale film, Greene 
			had wanted to use square safe areas, but his inexperience in coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which persisted 
			to Battlegrounds. </div></p>

			<p><div> When DayZ became its own standalone title, interest in his ARMA 2 version of the Battle Royale mod trailed off, and Greene 
			transitioned development of the mod to ARMA 3. Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become 
			interested in Greene's work, and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1, licensing the battle royale idea from him. In 
			February 2016, Sony Online split H1Z1 into two separate games, the survival mode H1Z1: Just Survive, and the battle royale-like H1Z1: King 
			of the Kill, around the same time that Greene's consultation period was over.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Separately, the Seoul-based studio Ginno Games, led by Chang-han Kim and who developed massively multiplayer online 
			games (MMOs) for personal computers, was acquired and renamed Bluehole Ginno Games by Bluehole in January 2015, a major 
			South Korean publisher of MMOs and mobile games. Kim recognized that producing a successful game in South Korea generally 
			meant it would be published globally, and wanted to use his team to create a successful title for personal computers that followed 
			the same model as other mobile games published by Bluehole. He had already been excited about making a type of battle royale 
			game after he had played DayZ, in part that the format had not caught on in Korea. He also wanted to make this through an early 
			access model and have a very limited development schedule to get the game out as quickly as possible, while treating the product 
			as a "games as a service" model to be able to support it for many years.] In researching what had been done, he came across 
			Greene's mods and reached out to him. In July 2017, Bluehole partnered with social media platform Facebook to provide exclusive 
			streaming content to Facebook's gaming channels, as part of their push to provide more gaming content for 
			its users. </div></p>

			<p><div> Around the same time that Greene left Sony Online, Kim contacted and offered him the opportunity to work on a new battle 
			royale concept. Within a week, Greene flew out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the options, and a few weeks later, 
			became the creative director of Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development. According to Greene, this was the first 
			time a Korean game studio had brought aboard a foreigner for a creative director role, and while a risk, he says that his relationship 
			with Bluehole's management is strong, allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal oversight. The game's main 
			musical theme was composed by Tom Salta, who was personally selected by Greene as he and the team were looking for an 
			"orchestral electronic hybrid theme" that would give players a "huge build-up", keeping them "resolutely determined" until a 
			match starts.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Development began in early 2016 and was publicly announced that June, with plans to have the game ready within a year. 
			Kim served as executive producer for the game. Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's work, 
			but had expanded to 70 by June 2017. Greene stated that many of these developers were voluntarily putting in longer work hours 
			into the game due to their dedication to the project, and not by any mandate from himself or Bluehole's management. In addition to 
			Bluehole, Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive, the developers of ARMA and DayZ, for support with motion capture animations via 
			their Prague studio.  </div></p>

			<p><div> With the rapid growth of interest in the game, Bluehole spun out the entire development for PUBG into Bluehole Ginno Games 
			in September 2017, which was renamed PUBG Corporation with Kim as its chief executive officer. PUBG Corporation continued the 
			development of the game and its marketing and growth, opening an office in the United States with plans for future ones in Europe and 
			Japan. In August 2018, PUBG Corporation launched the "Fix PUBG" campaign, acknowledging that that game by then still had several 
			lingering bugs and other performance issues. The campaign finished in November, with PUBG Corporation calling it a success as 
			everything listed had been implemented by then.  </div></p>

			<p><div> In March 2019, Greene announced that he was stepping down as the game's lead designer, but would still serve as a 
			creative consultant. Tae-seok Jang, the game's art director, would replace him, with Green relocating to PUBG's studio in Amsterdam, 
			PUBG Special Projects. Greene stated that he believed the main PUBG team was at a place to continue developing the game in the 
			direction he had set to keep the game unique among the other battle royale games it had launched, and he wanted to try something 
			not tied to battle royale but still multiplayer-based. The move also put him closer to his family in Ireland.  </div></p>

			<p><div> With the success of PUBG, Bluehole created Krafton as a holding company for its video game assets and studios in 
			2018, taking over the publishing duties for PUBG and related games. By December 2020, Krafton merged PUBG Corporation 
			into their internal studio system, rebranding the team as PUBG Studios. </div></p><br><br>

			<dd><p><div> Bluehole used closed alpha and beta periods with about 80,000 players to gauge initial reaction to the gameplay and adjust 
			balance prior to a wider release. Just prior to the early access phase on Steam, Bluehole opened a few servers and invited some 
			popular live streamers of similar games to try it out as to start gaining interest. Early access for the Windows version launched on 
			March 23, 2017. This period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release. In July 2017, 
			Greene announced that they would need to extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular 
			basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period "could hinder us from delivering a fully featured 
			game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met".  </div></p>

			<p><div>  Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, 
			and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from 
			early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside 
			gameplay improvements. Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates 
			that provided key performance improvements. However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high 
			frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the 
			community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release, where it fully released out of early 
			access on December 20. </div></p>

			<p><div> PUBG Lite is a free version of PUBG that is meant to be better playable on low-end computers by having significant 
			reductions in graphic details and other features, but is otherwise feature complete with the full game. The version is meant to 
			be played in regions where the game's minimum specifications may be difficult for average players to achieve, with a beta launch first 
			releasing in Thailand in January 2019, and in Europe that October. PUBG Lite was shut down on April 29, 2021. </div></p>

			<p><div> The personal computer and console versions of PUBG will transition to a free to play model on January 12, 2022. 
			A new account tier, called Battleground Plus, will be available for purchase that includes additional customization items and in-game 
			experience boosts, with owners of the game that had purchased it before this date being provided an upgrade to Battleground 
			Plus automatically. </div></p>

			<p><div> On January 12, 2022, the game has become free to play. With this update, players who want to play in a ranked mode 
			or play in custom matches need to pay $13 for the Battlegrounds Plus service. Players who previously owned the game received 
			Battlegrounds Plus for free. </div></p></dd>

			<dd><p><div> Greene was part of Microsoft's press conference during E3 2017 to announce that PUBG would be coming to Xbox One as a 
			timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017, using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to test it. Initially, Greene 
			said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most 
			of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer. However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that
			Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version. <br>Greene 
			said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security 
			of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, they have been able to talk and 
			incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved water rendering techniques they obtained from Rare that they had 
			developed for Sea of Thieves.Microsoft considered PUBG to be an important project to demonstrate their company's ability to be 
			more than just a publisher, according to Microsoft's Nico Bihary who lead the project. Bihary said they have given PUBG a "white glove" 
			treatment, and for the Xbox One port have provided services from their advanced technology group and time and support from The 
			Coalition, another of Microsoft Studios' subsidiaries. Kim also stated that the team was interested in cross-platform play between the 
			Windows and console versions, but did not anticipate this as a release feature, as they need to determine how to mitigate the 
			advantage keyboard and mouse-using players would have over those using controllers. </div></p></dd>

			<dt><u><h3>Mobile Versions</h3></u></dt>

			<dd><p><div> Following the Chinese publication deal for the Windows version, Tencent Games and PUBG Corporation additionally announced that 
			they were planning on releasing two mobile versions based on the game in the country. The first, PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield, is an 
			abridged version of the original game, and was developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, an internal division of Tencent Games. 
			The second, PUBG: Army Attack, includes more arcade-style elements, including action taking place on warships, and was developed 
			by Tencent's Timi Studio. Both versions are free-to-play, and were released for Android and iOS devices on 
			February 9, 2018.  </div></p>

			<p><div> The games had a combined total of 75 million pre-registrations, and ranked first and second on the Chinese iOS download charts 
			at launch. Following a soft launch in Canada, an English version of Exhilarating Battlefield, localized simply as PUBG Mobile, was released 
			worldwide on March 19, 2018. Following its release, a Korean and Japanese oriented version of the game released in June 2018, under 
			the title name PUBG Mobile KR. A Vietnamese version, PUBG Mobile VN released in January 2019. </div></p></dd>

<p><h1><u>APPLE TV+</u></h1><p>


<font size="+2"><b><p>Apple TV+ is an American subscription streaming service owned and operated by Apple Inc. Launched on November 1, 2019, it offers a selection of original production film and television series called Apple Originals. The service was announced during the Apple Special Event of March 2019, where celebrities from Apple TV+ projects appeared on-stage, among them Jennifer Aniston, Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and Jason Momoa.

The service can be accessed through Apple's website and through the Apple TV app, which has gradually become available for many Apple devices and some major competing streaming devices, including some smart TV models and video-game consoles. Apple plans to expand the services' availability, and there are workarounds for subscribers whose device is not presently supported. Access is included in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_One">Apple One subscription bundle.</a> Most of the content is available in Dolby Vision profile 5 and Atmos.
Upon its debut, Apple TV+ was available in about 100 countries, fewer than the reported target of 150.By early 2020, Apple TV+ had poor growth and low subscriber numbers relative to competing services. In the middle of that year, Apple began to license older television programs and films, attempting to stay competitive with other services, attract and retain a viewership for its original content, and convert into subscribers users who were trialling the service.</p></b></font>

<h1><u>HISTORY</u></h1>


<font size="+2"><b><p>Apple had long been rumored to have an interest in beginning a streaming television service, and in 2015 entered into negotiations with various television studios and programmers to aggregate their content for a live-television streaming bundle. Negotiations fell apart over differing views on how to value the content, lack of transparency on details, and the personality of Apple's chief negotiator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue">Eddy Cue</a>.

In October 2016, Apple CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Tim Cook</a> was reported as saying that television is "of intense interest to me and other people here." He added that Apple has started focusing on some original content which he called <i><b><u>"a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. So it's an area we're focused on.</p></u></b></i>


<p>In June 2017, Apple began to take the first major steps in forming its new television unit by hiring the co-presidents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television">Sony Pictures Television</a>, Jamie Elricht and Zack Van Amburg, to oversee all aspects of worldwide video programming. For the rest of 2017, Apple continued to fill out its executive team for Apple TV+, with Kim Rozenfeld joining as Head of Current Programming and Unscripted, Jay Hunt joining as Creative Director for Europe, Morgan Wandell joining as Head of International Creative Development, Tara Sorensen joining as Head of Kids Programming, and Max Aronson, Ali Woodruff, Carina Walker, and Michelle Lee joining as development and creative executives.</p></b></font>


<h1><u>PROGRAMMING</u></h1>


<font size="+2"><b><p>During the announcement of Apple TV+, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.">Apple</a> announced a number of prominent names of writers, directors, and stars that will be featured in the service. Apple decided to use the very large budget set aside for the service to pay for celebrity entertainers and high-profile talent as a "catnip" to draw viewers to Apple TV+.

As of March 2019, five of the upcoming series had already completed production, with six more already well into filming. On September 10, 2019, Apple announced that Apple TV+ would have eight original series (seven scripted and one non-scripted) and one original documentary available at launch, with plans to launch new original content every month thereafter. Most series are expected to launch with three episodes, with a new episode being released weekly thereafter, although Apple has stated that not all series will follow this model and that some series might instead launch all at once.

Early critical reaction to the bulk of the service's programming was mixed to poor, but with commentators predicting that Apple would have time to grow into its new role as a content provider and to produce well-regarded content, especially as the free year of the service provided with many Apple product purchases would entice users to continue watching, and for some to eventually pay for a subscription, as new series are released. On March 13, 2020, Apple suspended all active filming on Apple TV+ shows due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and all production on series was postponed for an undetermined period of time.</p></b></font>


<h1><u>GROWTH & IMPACT</u></h1>


<font size="+2"><b><p>Apple has announced a number of partnerships, bundles, and initiatives to increase subscriber growth in the service.

By February 2020, about 10 million people had signed up for Apple TV+. This included users who received a free one-year trial with the purchase of an Apple device, although it was estimated that less than 10% of Apple device owners eligible for the trial had activated it, perhaps out of Apple's failure to promote the service, Apple's desire to slow the uptake rate due to accounting concerns, or because of users' lack of interest in the service's perceived poor content options. About half of those 10 million users actively used the service.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S#Xbox_Series_S">Series S and Series X</a>) was seen as potentially boosting subscriber numbers for Apple TV+, including as part of Apple One subscription bundle purchases. On December 16, 2020, Google announced it would add the Apple TV app to its Chromecast with Google TV device in early 2021, and to its Android TV platform by June 1, 2021; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> subsequently made Apple TV available on its Chromecast with Google TV, as well as on select Sony and TCL smart TVs running the Google TV interface, on February 18, 2021. On December 18, 2020, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Urban_Film_Festival">British Urban Film Festival</a> announced that it was to be the first UK film festival to host all of its official selections on the Apple TV app.</p></b></font>

			<p><div> Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. 
			The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard 
			Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with 
			each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently 
			controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a 
			match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's 
			heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large 
			structure located within their base.  </div><p>

			<p><div> Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the Ancients, was hired 
			by Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine. It was released for Microsoft Windows, 
			OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta phase 
			that began two years prior. The game is fully free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing 
			to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To maintain it, Valve supports the game as a service, selling loot boxes and a 
			battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such as 
			hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs. The game was ported to the Source 2 engine in 2015, making it the 
			first game to use it.  </div><p>

			<p><div>  Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional 
			leagues and tournaments. Valve manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, a series of tournaments 
			that award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International, the game's premier annual 
			tournament. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts in upwards of US$40 
			million, making Dota 2 the most lucrative esports game. Media coverage of most tournaments is done by a selection 
			of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. 
			In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums, broadcasts of them are also streamed over the 
			internet and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions. </div><p>

			<p><div>  espite some criticism going towards its steep learning curve and overall complexity, Dota 2 was praised 
			for its rewarding gameplay, production quality, and faithfulness to its predecessor, with many considering it to be 
			one of the greatest video games of all time. It has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release, 
			with over a million concurrent players at its peak. The popularity of the game has led to official merchandise and 
			media adaptations for it being produced, including comic books and an anime series, as well as promotional tie-ins 
			to other games and media. The game also allows for the community to create their own gamemodes, maps, and 
			cosmetics, which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop. Two spinoff games, Artifact and Dota Underlords, were also 
			released by Valve. Dota 2 has also been used in machine learning experiments, with a team of bots known as the 
			OpenAI Five showing the capability to defeat professional players. </div><p>

			<u><h2 id = "gameplay" > Gameplay </h2><hr></u>
			

			<p><div>  Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players 
			compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", 
			whilst defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time 
			strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. 
			Ten players each control one of the game's 123 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having their 
			own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, known as the 
			core and support. </div><p>

			<div style= "float : right">
			<img src= "https://www.ebetfinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dota-2-gameplay-ebetfinder-resized.jpg" width= "500" height= "300" border="25%" ></div>

			<p><div> Cores, which are also called carries, begin each match as weak and vulnerable, but are able to 
			become more powerful later in the game, thus becoming able to "carry" their team to victory. Supports 
			generally lack abilities that deal heavy damage, instead having ones with more functionality and utility that 
			provide assistance for their cores, such as providing healing and other buffs. Players select their hero during a 
			pre-game drafting phase, where they can also discuss potential strategies and hero matchups with their 
			teammates. Heroes are removed from the drafting pool and become unavailable for all other players once one 	
			is selected, and can not be changed once the drafting phase is over. All heroes have a basic attack in addition 
			to powerful abilities, which are the primary method of fighting. Each hero has at least four of them, all of 
			which are unique. Heroes begin each game with an experience level of one, only having access to one of their 
			abilities, but are able to level up and become more powerful during the course of the game, up to a maximum 
			level of 30. Whenever a hero gains an experience level, the player is able to unlock another of their abilities or 
			improve one already learned. The most powerful ability for each hero is known as their "ultimate", which requires 
			them to have an experience level of six in order to use.  </div><p>

			<p><div> In order to prevent abilities from being used without consequence, a magic system is featured in the 
			game. Activating an ability costs a hero some of their "mana points", which slowly regenerates over time. Using 
			an ability will also cause it to enter a cooldown period, in which the ability can not be used again until a timer 
			resets. All heroes have three attributes: strength, intelligence, and agility, which affect health points, mana points, 
			and attack speed, respectively. Each hero has one primary attribute out of the three, which adds to their non-ability 
			basic damage output when increased, among other minor buffs. Heroes also have an ability augmentation 
			system known as the "Talent Tree", which allow players more choices on how to develop their hero. If a hero runs 
			out of health points and dies, they are removed from active play until a timer counts down to zero, where they are 
			then respawned in their base with only some gold lost. </div><p>

			<p><div> The two teams—known as the Radiant and Dire—occupy fortified bases in opposite corners of the map, 
			which is divided in half by a crossable river and connected by three paths, which are referred to as "lanes". 
			The lanes are guarded by defensive towers that attack any opposing unit who gets within its line of sight. A small 
			group of weak computer-controlled creatures called "creeps" travel predefined paths along the lanes and attempt 
			to attack any opposing heroes, creeps, and buildings in their way. Creeps periodically spawn throughout the game 
			in groups from two buildings, called the "barracks", that exist in each lane and are located within the team's bases.
			The map is also permanently covered for both teams in fog of war, which prevents a team from seeing the opposing 
			team's heroes and creeps if they are not directly in sight of themselves or an allied unit. The map also features a 
			day-night cycle, with some hero abilities and other game mechanics being altered depending on the time of the 
			cycle. Also present on the map are "neutral creeps" that are hostile to both teams, and reside in marked locations 
			on the map known as "camps". Camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the "jungle", which both 
			sides of the map have.  </div><p>

			<p><div> Neutral creeps do not attack unless provoked, and respawn over time if killed. The most powerful neutral 
			creep is named "Roshan", who is a unique boss that may be defeated by either team to obtain special items, such 
			as one that allows a one-time resurrection if the hero that holds it is killed. Roshan will respawn around 
			ten minutes after being killed, and becomes progressively harder to kill as the match progresses over time. 
			Runes, which are special items that spawn in set positions on the map every few minutes, offer heroes temporary, 
			but powerful power-ups when collected, such as double damage and invisibility  </div><p>

			<div style= "float : left">
			<img src= "https://www.ascinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dota2-gameplay.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="25%"></div>

			<p><div> In addition to having abilities becoming stronger during the game, players are able to buy items from set 
			locations on the map called shops that provide their own special abilities. Items are not limited to specific heroes, 
			and can be bought by anyone. In order to obtain an item, players must be able to afford it with gold at shops 
			located on the map, which is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes, destroying enemy structures, and killing 
			creeps, with the latter being an act called "farming".Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep 
			obtains gold from it, an act called "last hitting", but all allies receive a share of gold when an enemy hero dies close 
			to them. Players are also able to "deny" allied units and structures by last hitting them, which then prevents 
			their opponents from getting full experience from them. Gold can not be shared between teammates, with 
			each player having their own independent stash. Players also receive a continuous, but small stream of gold over 
			the course of a match.  </div><p>

			<p><div> Multiple game types in the game exist, which mainly alter the way hero selection is handled; examples 
			include "All Pick", which offer no restrictions on hero selection, "All Random", which randomly assigns a hero for 
			each player, "Captain's Mode", where a single player on each team selects heroes for their entire team and is 
			primarily used for professional play, and "Turbo", an expedited version of All Pick featuring increased gold and 
			experience gain, weaker towers, and faster respawn times. Matches usually last around 30 minutes to 
			an hour, although they can last forever as long as both Ancients remain standing. In Captain's Mode games, 
			an additional "GG" forfeit feature is available to end games early. Dota 2 also occasionally features limited-time 
			events that present players with alternative game modes that do not follow the game's standard rules. Some of 
			these included the Halloween-themed Diretide event, the Christmas-themed Frostivus event, and the New Bloom 
			Festival, which celebrated the coming of spring. Other special game modes have also been created by Valve, 
			including a ten-versus-ten mode, a Halloween-themed capture point mode "Colosseum", a combat arena mode 
			"Overthrow", "Siltbreaker", a story-driven cooperative campaign mode, and "The Underhollow", 
			a battle royale mode.  </div><p>

			<p><div> The move to the Source 2 engine in 2015 also added the "Arcade" feature, which allows for community-
			created game modes, with the more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by Valve. One popular example, 
			known as Dota Auto Chess, had over seven million in-game subscribers by April 2019. Owing to its popularity, Valve 
			met with the mod's developers, the Chinese-based Drodo Studio, to discuss directly collaborating on a standalone 
			version. However, the two companies were unable to come to an agreement, with them both stating that it was in 
			their best interest to develop their own separate games. Valve's version, Dota Underlords, was released in February 
			2020 and continued to use the Dota setting, while Drodo's game, Auto Chess, was developed using no Dota 2 
			assets.  </div><p>

			<u><h2 id = "development">Devlopment</h2><hr></u>

			<p><div>  The Dota series began in 2003 with Defense of the Ancients (DotA)—a mod for Blizzard Entertainment's 
			Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos—created by the pseudonymous designer "Eul". An expansion pack for Warcraft III, The 
			Frozen Throne, was released later that year; a series of Defense of the Ancients clone mods for the new game 
			competed for popularity. DotA: Allstars by Steve Feak was the most successful, and Feak, with his friend Steve 
			Mescon, created the official Defense of the Ancients community website and the holding company DotA-Allstars, 
			LLC. When Feak retired from DotA: Allstars in 2005, a friend, under the pseudonym IceFrog, became its lead designer.
			 By the late 2000s, Defense of the Ancients became one of the most popular mods worldwide, as well as a 
			prominent esports game. IceFrog and Mescon later had a falling out in May 2009, which prompted the former to 
			establish a new community website at playdota.com. Valve's interest in the Dota intellectual property began 
			when several veteran employees, including Team Fortress 2 designer Robin Walker and executive Erik Johnson, 
			became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel. The company corresponded with IceFrog by 
			email about his long-term plans for the project, and he was subsequently hired to direct a sequel. IceFrog first 
			announced his new position through his blog in October 2009, with Dota 2 being officially announced a year
 			later. </div><p>

			<p><div> Valve adopted the word "Dota", derived from the original mod's acronym, as the name for its newly 
			acquired franchise. Johnson argued that the word referred to a concept, and was not an acronym. Shortly after 
			the announcement of Dota 2, Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name. At Gamescom 2011, company 
			president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already-identifiable 
			brand. Holding the Dota name to be a community asset, Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for Dota on 
			behalf of DotA-Allstars, LLC (then a subsidiary of Riot Games) in August 2010. Rob Pardo, the executive vice 
			president of Blizzard Entertainment at the time, similarly stated that the Dota name belonged to the mod's 
			community. Blizzard acquired DotA-Allstars, LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in 
			November 2011, citing Blizzard's ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA-Allstars, LLC as proper 
			claims to the franchise name. The dispute was settled in May 2012, with Valve retaining commercial rights to 
			the Dota trademark, while allowing non-commercial use of the name by third-parties. In 2017, Valve's ownership 
			of franchise was again challenged, after a 2004 internet forum post from Eul was brought to light by a Chinese 
			company known as uCool, who had released a mobile game in 2014 that used characters from the Dota universe. 
			uCool, who was previously involved in a lawsuit with Blizzard in 2015 for similar reasons, along with another 
			Chinese company, Lilith Games, argued that the forum post invalidated any ownership claims of the intellectual 
			property, stating that the Dota property was an open-source, collective work that could not be copyrighted by 
			anyone in particular. Judge Charles R. Breyer denied uCool's motion for summary dismissal, with Blizzard filing 
			motions to dismiss all claims against uCool and Lilith with prejudice.  </div><p>

			<p><div> An early goal of the Dota 2 team was the adaptation of Defense of the Ancients' aesthetic style for the 
			Source engine. The Radiant and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod, respectively. 
			Character names, abilities, items and map design from the mod were largely retained, with some changes due to 	
			trademarks owned by Blizzard. In the first Q&A session regarding Dota 2, IceFrog explained that the game would 
			build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core. Valve contracted major contributors from 
			the Defense of the Ancients community, including Eul and artist Kendrick Lim, to assist with the sequel. 
			Additional contributions from sources outside of Valve were also sought regularly for Dota 2, as to continue 
			Defense of the Ancients' tradition of community-sourced development. One of the composers of Warcraft III: 
			Reign of Chaos, Jason Hayes, was hired to collaborate with Tim Larkin to write the original score for the game, 
			which was conducted by Timothy Williams and performed and recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Bastyr 
			University. Valve had Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw, science fiction author Ted Kosmatka, and Steam support 
			employee Kris Katz write new dialog and background lore for the heroes. Notable voice actors for heroes include 
			Nolan North, Dave Fennoy, Jon St. John, Ellen McLain, Fred Tatasciore, Merle Dandridge, Jen Taylor, and John 
			Patrick Lowrie, among others.</div><p>

			<p><div> The Source engine itself was updated with new features to accommodate Dota 2, such as high-end cloth 
			modeling and improved global lighting. The game features Steam integration, which provides its social component 
			and cloud storage for personal settings. In November 2013, Valve introduced a coaching system that allows 
			experienced players to tutor newer players with in-game tools. As with previous Valve multiplayer games, 
			players are able to spectate live matches of Dota 2 played by others, and local area network (LAN) multiplayer 
			support allows for local competitions. Some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the 
			"Dota Store", which give players in-game access to matches. Ticket fees are apportioned in part to tournament 
			organizers. The game also features an in-game fantasy sports system, which is modeled after traditional fantasy 
			sports and feature professional Dota 2 players and teams. Players are also able to spectate games in virtual 
			reality (VR) with up to 15 others, which was added in an update in July 2016. The update also added a hero 
			showcase mode, which allows players to see all of the heroes and their cosmetics full-size in virtual 
			reality.  </div><p>

			<p><div> As part of a plan to develop Dota 2 into a social network, Newell announced in April 2012 that the game 
			would be free-to-play, and that community contributions would be a cornerstone feature. Instead, revenue is 
			generated through the "Dota Store", which offers for-purchase cosmetic virtual goods, such as custom armor and 
			weapons for their heroes. It was also announced that the full roster of heroes would be available at launch for free. 
			Until the game's official release in 2013, players were able to purchase an early access bundle, which included a 
			digital copy of Dota 2 and several cosmetic items. Included as optional downloadable content (DLC), the Dota 2 
			Workshop Tools are a set of Source 2 software development kit (SDK) tools that allow content creators to create 
			new hero cosmetics, as well as custom game modes, maps, and bot scripts. Highly rated cosmetics, through the 
			Steam Workshop, are available in the in-game store if they are accepted by Valve. This model was fashioned after 
			Valve's Team Fortress 2, which had earned Workshop designers of cosmetic items of that game over $3.5 million by 
			June 2011. Newell revealed that the average Steam Workshop contributor for Dota 2 and Team Fortess 2 made 
			approximately $15,000 from their creations in 2013. By 2015, sales of Dota 2 virtual goods had earned Valve over 
			$238 million in revenue, according to the digital game market research group SuperData. In 2016, Valve introduced 
			the "Custom Game Pass" option for creators of custom game modes, which allows them to be funded by way of 
			microtransactions by adding exclusive features, content, and other changes to their game mode for players who 
			buy it.  </div><p>

			<p><div> Dota 2 includes a seasonal Elo rating-based matchmaking system, which is measured by a numerical value 
			known as "matchmaking rating" (MMR) that is tracked separately for core and support roles, and ranked into 
			different tiers. MMR is updated based on if a player won or lost, which will then increase or decrease respectively. 
			The game's servers, known as the "Game Coordinator",attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR, 
			with each team having roughly a 50% chance to win in any given game. Ranked game modes with a separately 
			tracked MMR are also available, which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible, 
			as well as requiring the registration of a phone number to their accounts, which help foster a more competitive 
			environment. To ensure that each player's ranking is up to date and accurate, MMR is recalibrated around every 
			six months. Players with the highest possible medal rank are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard, separated 

			<div style= "float : right">
			<img src= "https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/apps/dota2/images/reborn/day1/DotaTV.jpg" width= "520" height= "350" border="25%"></div>

			into North American, European, Southeast Asian, and Chinese regions. The game also includes a report system, 
			which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience. Players who 
			get reported enough or leave several games before they conclude, a practice known as "abandoning", are then 
			placed into low priority matchmaking, which remains on a player's account until they win a specific number of 
			games, and only groups them with other players who also have the same punishment. Other features include an 
			improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients, in which a completed game can be downloaded in-client and 
			viewed by anyone at a later time, and the "hero builds" feature, which provide integrated guides created by the 
			community that highlight to the player on how to play their hero.  </div><p>
 
			<u><h3 id = "dota2reborn"> Dota 2 Reborn </h3> <hr></u>

			<p><div>  In June 2015, Valve announced that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 
			game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn.[96] Reborn was first released as an opt-in beta update that same 
			month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015, making it the first game to use the engine. 
			Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created by the community, 
			and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties 
			players experienced with the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen 
			percent the month following its release. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent 
			players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that number being the largest in nearly a year. 
			The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, released as an optional feature in May 
			2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to use it. </div><p>

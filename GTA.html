			<p><div> Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.Later 
			titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is 
			primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent 
			company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term "grand theft auto", used in the United States 
			for motor vehicle theft. </div></p>

			<p><div> Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, 
			as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional 
			role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. 
			The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time 
			from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City)
			, San Andreas (based on San Francisco), and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting; 
			usually one of the original three locales, albeit remodelled and significantly expanded. The series centers on different 
			protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary 
			in each title. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or their organisation, or 
			characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Several film and music veterans have 
			voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, 
			Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.  </div></p>

			<p><div> DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists 
			of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is 
			considered a landmark game, as it brought the series to a three-dimensional (3D) setting and more immersive 
			experience. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and received 
			significant acclaim. They have influenced other open-world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on 
			similar titles. </div></p>

			<p><div> The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among 
			the greatest and best selling video games; it has shipped more than 370 million units, making it the fifth-best selling video 
			game franchise. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest 
			organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most 
			successful exports. The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes. </div></p>

			<p><div> The Grand Theft Auto series is split into separate fictional universes, named after the primary level of graphics 
			capability used in each era. The original Grand Theft Auto, its expansions and its sequel are considered the "2D universe". 
			Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels are considered the "3D universe". Grand Theft Auto IV, its expansions and Grand 
			Theft Auto V are considered the "HD universe". Each universe is considered separate with only brands, place names 
			and background characters shared between them. </div></p>

			<p><div> Grand Theft Auto, the first game in the series, was released for Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS in November 
			1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1998 and the Game Boy Color in 1999. Grand Theft Auto 2 was released in 1999 for 
			Microsoft Windows, later receiving ports on the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color. </div></p>

			<p><div> The PlayStation 2 also featured three instalments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on 
			several platforms; a deal between Take-Two Interactive and Sony Computer Entertainment resulted in their timed 
			exclusivity on the PlayStation 2, before receiving ports to Microsoft Windows and the Xbox. The 2001 title Grand Theft 
			Auto III moved away from the two-dimension (2D) graphics used in the first two games to three-dimension (3D) 
			computer graphics Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was published in 2002, and was the first to feature a speaking protagonist, 
			voiced by Ray Liotta. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004, introduced various new elements, including 
			character customisation and a large map encompassing three cities and surrounding rural area. </div></p>

			<p><div> Two main instalments were published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV 
			focused on realism and detail, removing various customisation features, while adding an online multiplayer mode. 
			Grand Theft Auto V, published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists. It was released to massive financial 
			success, breaking multiple records. It was later re-released with various enhancements, in 2014 for the PlayStation 
			4 and Xbox One, and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows; versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S were released 
			in March 2022. </div></p>

			<p><div> Each game in this series allows the player to take on the role of a criminal in the big city, typically an individual 
			who plans to rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. The player is given various 
			missions by kingpins and major idols in the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the storyline. 
			Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus 
			driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also involved in the game. </div></p>

			<p><div> In later titles, notably those released after Grand Theft Auto 2, the player is given a more developed storyline in 
			which they are forced to overcome an unfortunate event (e.g., being betrayed and left for dead), which serves as motivation 
			for the character to advance up the criminal ladder and ultimately leads to the triumph of the character by the end of the 
			storyline. </div></p>

			<p><div> The Grand Theft Auto series belongs to a genre of free-roaming role-playing video games called open world games, 
			and grants a large amount of freedom to the player. Traditional action games are structured as a single track series of 
			levels with linear gameplay, but in Grand Theft Auto the player can determine the missions that they want to undertake, 
			and their relationship with various characters are changed based on these choices. Influenced by the earlier game 
			Turbo Esprit, the cities of the games can be roamed freely at any point in the game, and are examples of open world 
			video game environments which offer accessible buildings with minor missions in addition to the main storyline. 
			There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot. These missions are required to complete in order to 
			unlock new areas in the game. </div></p>

			<p><div> Grand Theft Auto III and subsequent games have more voice acting and radio stations, which simulate driving 
			to music with disc jockeys, radio personalities, commercials, talk radio, pop music, and American culture. </div></p>

			<p><div> The use of vehicles in an explorable urban environment provides a basic simulation of a working city, complete 
			with pedestrians who generally obey traffic signals. Further details are used to flesh out an open-ended atmosphere 
			that has been used in several other games, such as The Simpsons: Hit & Run, which has less emphasis on crime or 
			violence, and Lego City Undercover, which reverses the roles of police officer and criminal, although the player goes 
			undercover in gangs for a portion of the game. </div></p>

			<p><div> Criminal activities in Grand Theft Auto games do not go unnoticed by the police. As the player engages in these 
			in-game illegal activities, they may gain a "wanted level", represented by a maximum of five or six stars. A small crime, 
			such as running over a non-player character, may create a one star wanted level situation, while shooting an officer 
			may earn more stars. As the number of stars increase, the amount and strength of the response will increase; a single 
			star might have a few police cars chase after the player, while at 5 or 6 stars, tanks and attack helicopters will chase 
			down the player. Many in-game missions will automatically give the player a wanted level after completing a certain 
			event which they must then get rid of before the mission is complete. Often, trying to keep away from the police while 
			wanted will cause the player to gain even higher wanted levels. The player can remove their character's wanted level by 
			avoiding detection or spending in-game money at specific locations to elude the police (such as a mod shop to repaint their 
			car). Alternatively, if the player-character dies, they will respawn at a hospital and the wanted level will be removed, though 
			the player may lose money, guns, and other benefits they had before being chased. The "wanted level" gameplay concept 
			has become common in similar open world games. </div></p>

			<u><h3 > Setting </h3> <hr></u>

			<p><div> Most Grand Theft Auto games are set in fictional parodies of well-known United States cities, in a n
			umber of different time periods. The games are split into three different universes (2D, 3D, and HD), each with their own 
			reinterpretations of previously established settings. The universes share the names of cities, several brands, and 
			background characters who never make physical appearances in the games (with a few exceptions), but are otherwise 
			considered to be separate continuities </div></p>

			<u><h3  id = "sanfrancisco"> San Andreas </h3> <hr></u>

			<p><div> San Andreas, based on San Francisco, is one of the three original cities introduced in Grand Theft Auto. It is 
			the second setting available to the player. The locale encompasses two landmasses: a large northern portion, which 
			is divided into fifteen districts and generally considered to be the city's core, and a smaller island in the southeast, 
			consisting of only one district, which acts as the city's docks area. The northern landmass is further divided by Aye Valley, 
			which cuts through the heart of the area from the east to the west. </div></p>

			<p><div> A reimagined version of San Andreas was featured in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (set in 1992), as a state 
			rather than a city. Based on California and Nevada, the state encompasses two landmasses, separated by a river and 
			surrounded by a large body of water. The southern portion of the map features the cities of Los Santos (based on Los 
			Angeles) and San Fierro (San Francisco), separated by vast forest and mountain areas. By contrast, the northern 
			portion is one large desert region and incorporates only one city, Las Venturas (Las Vegas). Both landmasses feature 
			additional rural settlements, which are less inhabited than the three major cities. The cities are connected by a train track 
			system, and each one features an airport, which can be used to fast travel from a city to another. At the beginning of the 
			game, players only have access to Los Santos, with the rest of the map being gradually unlocked as the story 
			progresses. </div></p>

			<p><div> A third version of San Andreas appeared in Grand Theft Auto V (set in 2013), again imagined as a state. 
			The game features only the southern portion of the state, which is depicted as a large island, located at an unknown 
			distance from the U.S. mainland. The southern portion of the island is occupied mostly by the city of Los Santos (which 
			resembles Los Angeles much more closely than its San Andreas counterpart), while the northern portion, known as 
			Blaine County, is less inhabited, featuring vast areas of desert, forest, and mountain, and only a few small towns. 
			This version of San Andreas is currently the only setting in the series that doesn't feature any map limitations, 
			allowing players to explore the entire island at the beginning of the game. Los Angeles was extensively researched 
			for Grand Theft Auto V. The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians and 
			captured around 250,000 photos and hours of video footage during these visits. Since the release of the game, 
			hundreds of in-game buildings have been identified as being based on real-world landmarks. The New Yorker's 
			Sam Sweet notes that, with sales of the game reaching thirteen million copies, "there will be more people living in the 
			imaginary state of Los Santos than in the real city on which it was modelled." </div></p>

			<u><h3  id = "liberty"> Liberty City </h3></u> <hr>

			<div style= "float : left">
			<img src= "https://www.sportsgamersonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2715612-firstperson11.jpg" width= "350" height= "250" border="25%"></div>

			<p><div> Liberty City, based on New York City, is one of the three original cities introduced in Grand Theft Auto. It is the first setting 
			available to the player. The city encompasses two landmasses (a large one in the southeast and a smaller one in the northeast) and 
			a Manhattan-like central island; two smaller islands are featured along the river that separates the three main islands. The setting 
			also incorporates the neighbouring state of New Guernsey (a parody of New Jersey), which occupies the northwest portion of the map. 
			All four major islands are divided into multiple districts, inspired by New York and New Jersey's boroughs. </div></p>

			<p><div> A redesigned version of Liberty City was introduced in Grand Theft Auto III (set in 2001). This iteration is only loosely based on 
			New York, and incorporates elements from other U.S. cities, such as Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, Chicago, and Baltimore. The city 
			encompassess three main islands, which are gradually unlocked as the game's storyline progresses: Portland (based on the industrial 
			areas of Brooklyn and Queens, with additional elements from Manhattan and Long Island), Staunton Island (based mostly on Manhattan), 
			and Shoreside Vale (loosely based on North Jersey, The Bronx, Staten Island, and Upstate New York). The islands are connected by 
			road bridges and an underground tunnel system. A tunnel leading out of Liberty City can be found in Shoreside Vale, but it is inaccessible 
			to the player. This particular version of Liberty City returned in the prequels Grand Theft Auto Advance (set in 2000) and Grand Theft Auto: 
			Liberty City Stories (set in 1998), albeit with several changes to reflect the different time periods. The city was also mentioned in Grand 
			Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and was the setting of a mission in the latter. </div></p>

			<p><div> A third version of Liberty City was featured in Grand Theft Auto IV, its expansion packs The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of 
			Gay Tony (all three set in 2008), and the handheld game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars (set in 2009). This iteration closely 
			resembles New York, and consists of four main boroughs, which become available to explore as the story progresses: Broker 
			(based on Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (The Bronx), and Algonquin (Manhattan). The placement of these boroughs mirrors that of 
			their real-life counterparts: Broker and Dukes occupy a large landmass in the southeast, while Bohan forms its own, smaller island in 
			the northeast, and Algonquin acts as the city's central island. The setting also incorporates three smaller islands—Charge Island 
			(Randall's Island), Colony Island (Roosevelt Island), and Happiness Island (Liberty Island)—and a fourth landmass, Alderney, which is 
			located west of Algonquin and regarded as its own independent state (similarly to New Jersey). Alderney is absent in Chinatown Wars.
			All islands, barring Happiness Island, are connected by road bridges, underground tunnels, and a subway system; none of which lead 
			out of the city. </div></p>

			<u><h3  id = "vice"> Vice City </h3></u> <hr>

			<p><div> Vice City, based on Miami, is one of the three original cities introduced in Grand Theft Auto. It is the third setting available to 
			the player. The city encompasses one large landmass, divided into eight districts which form the city's core, and a smaller island, Vice 
			Beach, in the northeast. Like its real-life counterpart, Vice City is depicted as a tropical city, easily distinguished from the other two in the 
			game by its beaches and palm trees. </div></p>

			<p><div> A redesigned version of Vice City was introduced in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (set in 1986). The city consists of two main 
			landmasses, Vice City Beach and Vice City Mainland, separated by a large body of water and connected to each other and to two smaller 
			islands, Starfish Island and Prawn Island, by a series of road bridges. At the beginning of the game, the player only has access to Vice 
			City Beach, with the rest of the city being gradually unlocked as the story progresses. The same setting would be later used in the 
			prequel Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (set in 1984), albeit with several changes to reflect the different time period. The HD universe 
			version of Vice City has yet to be introduced, but has been referenced in both Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand 
			Theft Auto V. </div></p>

			<u><h3 > Other Settings </h3></u> <hr>

			<p><div> The London 1969 and London 1961 expansion packs for Grand Theft Auto take place within a fictionalised version of London 
			during the 1960s. As such, they are the only games in the series to be set outside of the United States. The portion of the city used in the 
			games is based on Central London, although heavily condensed and mostly geographically inaccurate. It consists of two landmasses, 
			separated by the River Thames and connected by several road bridges. A fictionalised version of Manchester is also featured in the 
			games. </div></p>

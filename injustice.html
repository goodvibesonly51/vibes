			<p><div> Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting video game in the Injustice franchise based upon the fictional universe of 
			DC Comics. The game was developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment 
			for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U. It was released in April 2013 in North America, Europe, and Australia, and June 
			2013 in Japan. An expanded version of the game, titled Injustice: Gods Among Us – Ultimate Edition, was released in 
			November 2013 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. A free-
			to-play mobile app based on Injustice was also released for Android and iOS devices. A prequel comic book series of the 
			same name, written by Tom Taylor, was released beginning in January 2013. </div></p>

			<p><div> Players select one of several characters from the DC Universe (consisting of both villains and heroes), to 
			engage in combat, aiming to knock out their opponent. The game is set in a 2.5D environment: while character models 
			and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensional graphics, the characters are restricted to fight within a two-
			dimensional space. Injustice builds upon several aspects from NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Mortal Kombat, 
			including its controls, game mechanics, narrative-driven campaign, and online functionality. </div></p>

			<p><div> The storyline is set in a parallel universe within the DC Comics' Multiverse. In this reality, Superman becomes 
			a tyrant and establishes a new world order after the Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and destroying Metropolis 
			with a nuclear bomb. In an effort to stop this, Batman summons counterparts of the League's members from another 
			universe to join his insurgency and end the totalitarian regime. The game received positive reviews from critics, who 
			praised its story, gameplay mechanics, and use of the DC Comics license. Injustice became the highest selling game in 
			the United States and United Kingdom during the month of its release. The game also won several awards for 
			"Best Fighting Game" in 2013. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "gameplay" > Gameplay </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> Injustice: Gods Among Us is a fighting game in which players control characters with different fighting styles 
			and special attacks, engaging in one-on-one combat to deplete their opponent's life gauge. The game is in 2.5D: movement 
			is restricted to a two-dimensional plane, while the characters and backgrounds are rendered in three-dimensions. 
			Unlike the traditional fighting game design involving multiple rounds with regenerative life bars, Injustice uses a scheme 
			similar to the Killer Instinct series. Each match consists of a single round with each player bearing two life bars. 
			The game utilizes a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a "character trait" button, 
			which activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, Superman's character 
			trait provides a temporary boost in strength, while Batman's character trait summons a swarm of robotic 
			bats.  </div></p>

			<p><div> The stages, based on various locations from the DC Universe, such as the Batcave, Metropolis, and the 
			Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple areas. If an opponent is hit with a heavy attack near 
			a corner of the arena, it launches them, triggering a transition animation and taking the fight to a new section of the 
			stage. Each section also contains objects that characters can interact with differently depending on their class. 
			Characters fall into two classes: "power characters", who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and "gadget 
			characters", who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win. For example, a gadget character 
			like Batman can attach a bomb to a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman will pick up 
			the same car and smash his opponents with it. Players have the option to turn off interactive elements and stage 
			transitions. </div></p>

			<p><div> As characters perform special moves, block oncoming attacks, or get hit by the opponent, their "super meters" 
			will gradually fill. Portions of the super meter can be used to execute enhanced special moves or counter enemy moves. 
			With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend their meter to interrupt a 
			combo and enter a wager battle, dubbed the "clash system", which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with 
			the process of betting meter. A clash may be triggered by a player only after they have lost their first life bar. 
			During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning 
			the clash. </div></p>

			<p><div> The story mode is split into several chapters. As the narrative plays out, the player swaps between different 
			characters. Minigames are also incorporated into the story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming 
			battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional game features include Battle 
			Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying 
			difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match 
			while waiting for their turn to fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character 
			selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal 
			objectives, will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, 
			and other rewards. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "plot" > Plot </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> In a parallel universe, the Joker tricks Superman into killing his pregnant wife Lois Lane and detonating a 
			nuclear weapon that destroys Metropolis, killing millions of people. Mad with grief and rage, Superman murders the 
			Joker, quickly losing his moral compass. Five years later, Superman has formed the One Earth Regime to eliminate 
			crime and enforce global peace through fear, and rules the Earth as a ruthless dictator, the High Councillor, 
			alongside many other heroes and villains he recruited or forced into joining him and killing any who oppose him. 
			Batman establishes the Insurgency to oppose Superman's Regime, and the ensuing war between the two factions 
			leaves the Justice League disbanded. </div></p>

			<p><div> In the prime DC universe, the Joker also attempts to destroy Metropolis with a nuke supplied by Lex Luthor, 
			which will allow the latter to rebuild the city in his image, but is foiled by the Justice League. While Batman confronts the 
			Joker, the two are suddenly teleported into the Regime universe, where they find themselves pursued by Regime forces. 
			Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Arrow, and Green Lantern are also teleported there. The latter leaves to recharge his 
			power ring and rescues Deathstroke from being tortured by the Regime, while having altercations with Cyborg, Raven, 
			Sinestro, and his own Yellow Lantern counterpart. Meanwhile, Aquaman travels to Atlantis and defeats his counterpart, 
			who was planning to have Atlantis join the Regime. He then encounters Ares, who is weak from the virtual lack of conflict 
			and has allied with the Insurgency out of spite for the Regime. </div></p>

			<p><div> After regrouping, the prime heroes meet Insurgency Batman and Lex Luthor (who in this universe is Superman's 
			closest friend and an Insurgency mole) and receive nanotech pills derived from Kryptonian DNA, which increase their 
			strength to Superman's level. Batman and Luthor explain to the heroes that they teleported them into their universe to 
			help access a kryptonite weapon, which requires a DNA sample of all core Justice League members as their Green 
			Arrow is dead and the others have joined Superman; however, the prime Batman and Joker were teleported by 
			accident. Elsewhere, Batman is mistaken for his Insurgency counterpart and captured by the Regime, while the Joker 
			meets this universe's Harley Quinn, who is allied with the Insurgency and founded the "Joker Clan" in his memory. 
			After helping the Joker Clan fight off a Regime attack at Arkham Asylum, the Insurgents infiltrate the Batcave and 
			retrieve the kryptonite weapon. Meanwhile, in the prime universe, Superman and Flash's efforts to recover their 
			comrades result in Cyborg being inadvertently teleported into the Regime's universe, where he joins the Insurgency 
			and helps Deathstroke take over the Regime Watchtower. </div></p>

			<p><div> After Superman publicly announces his intentions to execute prime Batman, Insurgency Batman and Green Arrow 
			break into Stryker's Island to rescue him, while Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman stage an attack on the 
			Regime to distract them. After the Batmen and Green Arrow escape via the Watchtower's teleporter, Superman realizes 
			the Watchtower has been compromised and attempts to destroy it, but Deathstroke causes a chain explosion that sends 
			him plummeting back to Earth. Luthor attempts to incapacitate the weakened Superman with the kryptonite weapon, but is 
			stopped by Shazam, allowing Superman to execute him. Now aware of humanity's determination to depose him, Superman 
			decides to destroy Gotham City and Metropolis to demonstrate the chaos that would arise in his absence, and invade the 
			prime heroes' universe as punishment for their interference. When Shazam protests and invokes Lois’ memory, Superman 
			murders him, causing Flash to defect to the Insurgency and inform them of Superman's plan. </div></p>

			<p><div> During a Regime attack on the Insurgency's hideout, Wonder Woman is teleported by Ares to Themyscira, 
			where she defeats her Regime counterpart and convinces the Amazons to defect to the Insurgency. Meanwhile, prime 
			Batman convinces his counterpart to teleport prime Superman into this universe to help. During the ensuing battle 
			between the Insurgency and the Regime, Superman overpowers the Regime's top lieutenants and persuades Yellow 
			Lantern to surrender, before confronting his counterpart at the Fortress of Solitude, pitying his loss yet declaring the 
			planet needs freedom back. When his Regime self promises to bring Clark's Lois there, Clark reminds him Lois would 
			be mortified at the tyrant he has become. </div></p>

			<p><div> Following the evil Superman's defeat, the Regime is dissolved and its members imprisoned, barring Flash, 
			who is paroled, and Yellow Lantern, who is taken to Oa to be rehabilitated. While the prime heroes and Joker return 
			to their universe, Insurgency Batman and prime Superman oversee the imprisonment of the latter's counterpart 
			within a cell emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless. As they walk away, Superman voices his fears that 
			he could also go down a dark path if a similar tragedy happened to him. Batman says that he hopes this never happens, 
			but will stand up to him even if so. Regime Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his 
			powers left </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "characters" > Characters </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> The roster was selected internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the 
			selection process, which took around three to four months, was to create a cast featuring a wide variety of characters. 
			Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well they fit within the 
			Injustice storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development.  The characters 
			were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and 
			personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with 
			their properties, allowing them to put their own spin on characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, 
			such as Darkseid, Scarecrow, Metallo and Gorilla Grodd, also appear as non-player characters, making cameo 
			appearances in story cutscenes, stages and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, Scorpion from Nether
			Realm's Mortal Kombat series appears as a downloadable guest character.<br><br>

			<p><div> League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot 
			Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. 
			Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available 
			for Microsoft Windows and macOS. </div></p>

			<p><div> In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the 
			ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more 
			powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a 
			team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. </div></p>

			<p><div> League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. 
			The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its 
			players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight 
			million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series, Arcane. 
			Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game and a turn-based role-playing 
			game, among others. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the property is in development. </div></p>

			<p><div> Regularly cited as the world's largest esport, the game has an international competitive scene consisting of 12 leagues. These domestic 
			leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a 
			concurrent viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, 
			Bilibili, and on cable television sports channel ESPN. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "gameplay" > Gameplay </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique 
			abilities from an isometric perspective. As of November 2021, there are 157 champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain 
			levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies. Items can be acquired to increase champions' strength, and are bought with gold, 
			which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures. In the main 
			game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to players only when their champion is in the team's base. 
			Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another. </div></p>


			<u><h3 id = "summoners"> Summoner's Rift </h3> </u><hr>

			<div style= "float : right">

			<p><div> Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most prominent in professional-level play. The mode has a ranked 
			competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are nine 
			tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures 
			known as "turrets" Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game and reappear after death. Non-player characters known 
			as minions are generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom. 
			Each team's base contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors 
			causes stronger allied minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.  
			The regions in between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. 
			Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that separates each team's jungle. 
			These monsters require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after 
			killing the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor. </div></p>

			<p><div> Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour. Although the game does not enforce where players may go, 
			conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the 
			bottom lane. Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. 
			A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a lane.  </div></p>

			<u><h3 id = "othermodes"> Other Modes </h3> </u><hr>

			<p><div> Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five 
			mode like Summoner's Rift, but on a map called Howling Abyss with only one long lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for players. 
			Given the small size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities. </div></p>

			<p><div> Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2019 and made a permanent game mode the following month. As with others in its genre, 
			players build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight 
			automatically against opponents each round. Teamfight Tactics is available for iOS and Android and has cross-platform play with the Windows and 
			macOS clients. </div></p>

			<p><div> Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning with in-game events. Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for 
			two weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased 
			movement speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks. A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its 
			unbalanced design resulted in player "burnout". The developer also said the costs associated with maintaining and balancing URF were too high. Other 
			temporary modes include One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all members of their team to play. In Nexus Blitz, players 
			participate in a series of mini-games on a compressed map. </div></p>

			<u><h3>Pre-release </h3></u>

			<p><div> Riot Games' founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients, known as DotA. A mod for 
			Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft III and install custom software; The Washington Post's Brian Crecente said the mod 
			"lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and set up. Phillip Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an 
			expansion pack, then shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be 
			supported over a significantly longer period. </div></p>

			<p><div> Beck and Merill held a DotA tournament for students at the University of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There they met 
			Jeff Jew, later a producer on League of Legends. Jew was very familiar with DotA and spent much of the tournament teaching others how to play. Beck and 
			Merill invited him to an interview, and he joined Riot Games as an intern. Beck and Merill recruited two figures involved with DotA: Steve Feak, one of its 
			designers,and Steve Mescon, who ran a support website to assist players. Feak said early development was highly iterative, comparing it to 
			designing DotA. </div></p>

			<p><div> A demonstration of League of Legends built in the Warcraft III game engine was completed in four months and then shown at the 2007 Game 
			Developers Conference. There, Beck and Merill had little success with potential investors. Publishers were confused by the game's free-to-play business 
			model and lack of a single-player mode. The free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian markets, so publishers were primarily interested in a retail 
			release, and the game's capacity for a sequel. In 2008, Riot reached an agreement with holding company Tencent to oversee the game's launch in
			 China. </div></p>

			<p><div> League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008, for Microsoft Windows. Closed beta-testing began in April 2009. Upon the launch of the beta, 
			seventeen champions were available. Riot initially aimed to ship the game with 20 champions but doubled the number before the game's full release in 
			North America on October 27, 2009. The game's full name was announced as League of Legends: Clash of Fates. Riot planned to use the subtitle to signal 
			when future content was available, but decided they were silly and dropped it before launch. </div></p>

			<u><h3>Post-release </h3></u>

			<p><div> League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy 
			dominated, League of Legends' patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch 
			cadence to once approximately every two or three weeks. </div></p>

			<p><div> The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of 
			producers creating audio for the game and its promotional materials. As of 2021, the game has over 150 champions, and Riot Games periodically overhauls 
			the visuals and gameplay of the oldest in the roster. Although only available for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available in 
			March 2013 </div></p>

			<u><h3> Revenue model </h3></u>

			<div style= "float : right">
			<img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/d/d3/Summoners_Rift_Summoner_Platforms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140624075315" width= "450" height= "350" border="25%"></div>

			<p><div> League of Legends uses a free-to-play business model. Several forms of purely cosmetic customization—for example, "skins" that change the 
			appearance of champions—can be acquired after buying an in-game currency called Riot Points (RP). Skins have five main pricing tiers, ranging from $4 
			to $25. As virtual goods, they have high profit margins A loot box system has existed in the game since 2016; these are purchasable virtual "chests" with 
			randomized, cosmetic items. These chests can be bought outright or acquired at a slower rate for free by playing the game. The practice has been 
			criticized as a form of gambling. In 2019, Riot Games' CEO said that he hoped loot boxes would become less prevalent in the industry. Riot has also 
			experimented with other forms of monetization. In August 2019, they announced an achievement system purchasable with Riot Points. The system was 
			widely criticized for its high cost and low value. </div></p>

			<p><div> In 2014, Ubisoft analyst Teut Weidemann said that only around 4% of players paid for cosmetics—significantly lower than the industry standard of
			 15 to 25%. He argued the game was only profitable because of its large player base. In 2017, the game had a revenue of US$2.1 billion; in 2018, a lower 
			figure of $1.4 billion still positioned it as one of the highest-grossing games of 2018 In 2019, the number rose to $1.5 billion, and again to $1.75 billion in 
			2020. According to magazine Inc., players collectively played three billion hours every month in 2016. </div></p>

			<u><h3> Plot </h3></u>

			<p><div> Before 2014, players existed in-universe as political leaders, or "Summoners", commanding champions to fight on the Fields of Justice—for example, 
			Summoner's Rift—to avert a catastrophic war. Sociologist Matt Watson said the plot and setting were bereft of the political themes found in other role-playing 
			games, and presented in reductive "good versus evil" terms. In the game's early development, Riot did not hire writers, and designers wrote character 
			biographies only a paragraph long. </div></p>

			<p><div> In September 2014, Riot Games rebooted the game's fictional setting, removing summoners from the game's lore to avoid "creative stagnation". 
			Luke Plunkett wrote for Kotaku that, although the change would upset long-term fans, it was necessary as the game's player base grew in size. Shortly 
			after the reboot, Riot hired Warhammer writer Graham McNeill.  Riot's storytellers and artists create flavor text, adding "richness" to the game, 
			but very little of this is seen as a part of normal gameplay. Instead, that work supplies a foundation for the franchise's expansion into other media, such 
			as comic books and spin-off video games. The Fields of Justice were replaced by a new fictional setting—a planet called Runeterra. The setting has 
			elements from several genres—from Lovecraftian horror to traditional sword and sorcery fantasy. </div></p><br>

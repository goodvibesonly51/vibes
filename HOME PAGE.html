			<p><div>An online game is a video game that is either partially or primarily played through the Internet or any other computer network available.
			Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs, consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person 
			shooters, strategy games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG).  In 2019, revenue in the online games segment reached 
			$16.9 billion, with $4.2 billion generated by China and $3.5 billion in the United States. Since 2010s, a common trend among online games has been 
			operating them as games as a service, using monetization schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes as purchasable items atop freely-offered 
			games. Unlike purchased retail games, online games have the problem of not being permanently playable, as they require special servers in order 
			to function. </div></p>

			<p><div> The design of online games can range from simple text-based environments to the incorporation of complex graphics and virtual worlds. The 
			existence of online components within a game can range from being minor features, such as an online leaderboard, to being part of core gameplay, 
			such as directly playing against other players.  Many online games create their own online communities, while other games, especially social games, 
			integrate the players' existing real-life communities.Some online games can receive a massive influx of popularity due to many well-known Twitch 
			streamers and YouTubers playing them.</div></p>

			<div><p>Online gaming has drastically increased the scope and size of video game culture. Online games have attracted players from a variety of ages, 
			nationalities, and occupations. The online game content can also be studied in the scientific field, especially gamers' interactions within virtual societies in 
			relation to the behavior and social phenomena of everyday life. As in other cultures, the community has developed a gamut of slang words or phrases 
			that can be used for communication in or outside of games. Due to their growing online nature, modern video game slang overlaps heavily with internet 
			slang, as well as leetspeak, with many words such "pwn" and "noob". Another term that was popularized by the video game community is the abbreviation 
			"AFK" to refer to people who are not at the computer or paying attention.  Other common abbreviations include "GL HF" which stands for "good luck, have 
			fun," which is often said at the beginning of a match to show good sportsmanship. Likewise, at the end of a game, "GG" or "GG WP" may be said to 
			congratulate the opponent, win or lose, on a "good game, well played".Many video games have also inspired internet memes and achieved a very 
			large following online.</div></p>
			
			<u><h2 id= "thingsuneedtoknow">Things you need to know about gaming </h2></u><hr>
			
			<p><div> Gaming is a fun and sociable way to spend time, encouraging teamwork and developing skills. All good stuff, but there are a few things 
			you need to be aware of: </p></div>
			
			<ol>
			<li> Some games let children play and chat with anyone in the world. This means they might come across offensive language and bullying</li> 

			<li> Not everyone online is who they say they are. Children should avoid giving out personal details that could identify them or their location </li>

			<li> Some games encourage players to buy extra elements during the game – children have been known to run up large bills without realising </li>

			<li> In extreme cases bullying, also known as ‘griefing’, can be used as a tactic to win games. Children may find themselves either bullying or 
			being bullied </li>

			<li> Get involved by finding out what type of games your child enjoys and making sure they’re appropriate for their age </li>

			<li> It can be hard to stop some games in the middle of a battle as there are penalties for quitting and children may feel they are 
			letting teammates down. </li>
			</ol>

				into a VR headset by downloading an app. Manufacturers are currently recommending that under 12s are to be supervised by an adult when using a 
				VR headset.

			<p><div> Hearthstone is a free-to-play online digital collectible card game developed and published by Blizzard 
			Entertainment. Originally subtitled Heroes of Warcraft, Hearthstone builds upon the existing lore of the Warcraft series 
			by using the same elements, characters, and relics. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in March 
			2014, with ports for iOS and Android releasing later that year. The game features cross-platform play, allowing players 
			on any supported device to compete with one another, restricted only by geographical region account limits. </div></p>

			<p><div> The game is a turn-based card game between two opponents, using constructed decks of 30 cards along 
			with a selected hero with a unique power. Players use their limited mana crystals to play abilities or summon minions 
			to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero. Winning matches and completing quests earn in-
			game gold, rewards in the form of new cards, and other in-game prizes. Players can then buy packs of new cards 
			through gold or microtransactions to customize and improve their decks. The game features several modes of play, 
			including casual and ranked matches, drafted arena battles, and single-player adventures. New content for the game 
			involves the addition of new card sets and gameplay, taking the form of either expansion packs or adventures that 
			reward the player with collectible cards upon completion. </div></p>

			<p><div> In contrast to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an experimental game developed by a 
			smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid 
			the pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's 
			turn and by replicating the feel of a physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the concepts as 
			well as art assets were based on those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading 
			Card Game. </div></p>

			<p><div> The game has been favorably reviewed by critics and has been a success for Blizzard, earning nearly 
			US$40 million per month as of August 2017. As of November 2018, Blizzard has reported more than 100 million 
			Hearthstone players. The game has become popular as an esport, with cash prize tournaments hosted by 
			Blizzard and other organizers. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "gameplay" > Gameplay </h2><hr></u>

			<div style= "float : left">
			<img src= "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lbjMA-jZWxkD7ccfrUigHMEbJWGUUlaef87WqLROsH8v9zyIg6gF3MUGffRn2BP-J4Fv=w412-h220-rw" width= "450" height= "300" border="25%"></div>

			<p><div> Set within the Warcraft universe, Hearthstone is a digital-only, turn-based collectible card game which pits 
			two opponents against each other. Players select a hero from one of ten classes. All classes have unique cards and 
			abilities, known as hero powers, which help define class archetypes. Each player uses a deck of cards from their 
			collection with the end goal being to reduce the opponent's health to zero. </div></p>

			<p><div> There are four different types of cards: minions, spells, weapons, and hero cards. Quests are a specific type 
			of spell only found in three expansions. These cards are ordered by rarity, with Legendary cards being the rarest, 
			followed by Epic, Rare, Common, and Basic. Blizzard releases expansions of additional cards every four months to 
			increase the variety in the metagame. The game uses a freemium model of revenue, meaning players can play for 
			free or pay to acquire additional card packs or content. </div></p>

			<p><div> Unlike other card games such as Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone was designed to speed up play by 
			eliminating any manual reactions from the opposing player during a player's turn, and setting a timer for each player's 
			turn. During a turn, players play cards from their hand using "mana", a budget each player must abide by which 
			increases by one each turn with a maximum of ten, and with cards having various mana costs. This invokes strategy 
			as the player must plan ahead, taking into account what cards can and cannot be played. Minions and spells are 
			unique. </div></p>

			<p><div> Minions will be placed directly onto the board after being played and may carry special effects like Charge or 
			Deathrattle, allowing the minion to attack instantly or making the minion do something special upon death, respectively. 
			Spells have distinctive effects and affect the board in various ways. Cards can be obtained through opening card packs or 
			by crafting them with arcane dust. </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "gamemodes" > Game Modes </h2></u><hr>

			<div style= "float : right">
			<img src= "https://blizzardwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/arena.jpg" width= "500" height= "350" border="25%"></div>


			<p><div> The normal gameplay mode is one-on-one matches between a player and a randomly selected human 
			opponent. Within this, the Standard game mode uses prepared decks limited to cards from the Core set alongside 
			the expansions from the last two years. A separate Wild game mode allows all past and present cards to be used 
			subject to deck construction rules. Both Standard and Wild game modes are divided into Casual and Ranked modes. 
			Players can climb the tiered ranking system in Ranked, while Casual allows for a more relaxed play-style. At the end 
			of each month, the Ranked season ends, rewarding players with in-game items depending on their 
			performance.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Other more specialized multiplayer modes include the following: Arena has the player draft a deck of thirty cards 
			from choices of three cards over several rounds. Players continue to use this deck against other Arena decks until they 
			win or loses a number of matches, after which the deck is retired and players gain in-game rewards based on their 
			record. Tavern Brawls are challenges that change weekly and may impose unusual deck-building guidelines. 
			Battlegrounds, introduced in November 2019, is based on the auto battler genre, allowing eight players to compete in 
			each match by recruiting minions over several rounds. Players are paired off randomly in each round, with combat 
			between minions played out automatically, with the goal of having minions remaining to damage the opponent's hero, 
			and ultimately be the last hero standing. The top four heroes place and earn a win and increase rating points. </div></p>

			<p><div> Duels, introduced in October 2020, is a multiplayer version of Hearthstone's singleplayer "Dungeon Run" 
			game mode. Players start with a 15-card deck they assemble themselves, and (like Arena) battle other players until 
			they win or lose a number of matches, after which the deck is retired and players gain in-game rewards based on 
			their record. After each match, the player chooses between three 'buckets' of three cards each, or a treasure card 
			to add to their deck. Unlike Arena, there is a casual mode that requires no entry fee. Classic mode uses a mirror of the 
			player's library of all cards that were in the game as of the June 2014 release of the game, reverting any updates or 
			changes to these cards in the interim, effectively representing the game's start at the time of its release.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Mercenaries, introduced in October 2021, is focused on a party-based combat system with roguelike 
			mechanics. A player creates a party from six minions from a central Minion Village and uses that party to complete 
			various quests, both as player-versus-environment and player-versus-player. Battles in this model use a color-
			coded system similar to rock paper scissors where minions of one color are strong against another color but 
			weak to the third color. Players use this system and minion abilities to try to win battles. With loot gained from 
			combat success, players can use facilities in the Minion Village to improve the attributes and abilities of individual 
			minions or recruit new minions.In addition to these multiplayer modes, there are solo adventures. These adventures 
			offer alternative ways to play and are designed specifically to challenge the player.  </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "development" > Development </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> The development of Hearthstone at Blizzard was inspired by two directions, according to developer Eric Dodds: a desire 
			for Blizzard to develop something more experimental with a smaller team in contrast to their larger projects, and the shared love 
			of collectible card games throughout the company. Blizzard executives, around 2008, had considered that their revenue was 
			primarily sustained on three well-established properties (the Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo series), but saw the rise of 
			small independent developers with highly successful projects, representing a shift in the traditional video game model. To explore 
			this new direction, Blizzard brought a number of people into "Team 5", named after being the fifth development team formed 
			at Blizzard. Initially, the team had between 12 and 15 members, in contrast to other Blizzard games with teams in excess of 
			60 members. By November 2015, the team had 47 members.  </div></p>

			<p><div> Of the game types they explored, Team 5 soon focused on the collectible card game approach, given that many on the 
			team and in Blizzard had played such games since their introduction. The team found it natural to build the card game around 
			the existing Warcraft lore; according to production director Jason Chayes, Warcraft was already a well-known property, and the 
			depth of characters and locations created for other games in that series made it easy to create cards inspired by those. They also 
			saw that new players to Warcraft may be drawn into the other games through playing Hearthstone </div></p>

			<p><div> The team was able to pull concepts and art from the pre-existing World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, first published in 
			2006 by Upper Deck and later by Cryptozoic Entertainment; when Hearthstone was near completion, in 2013, Blizzard terminated 
			its license with Cryptozoic as to favor their pending digital card game. The addition of heroes, an aspect from the previous trading 
			card game, was found to help personalize the game for the player to allow players to discover useful combinations of cards for 
			each hero </div></p>

			<u><h2 id = "Gamedesign" >Game design and programming </h2></u><hr>

			<p><div> After about a year of starting development, the team had produced an Adobe Flash prototype of the game that offered the 
			core card game mechanics and the unique heroes. At this point, several on Team 5 were temporarily moved into other teams to 
			complete the release of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. This 10-to-11 month period was considered fortuitous by the team, according 
			to Chayes. Principal designers Dodds and Ben Brode remained developing Hearthstone, and the two were able to quickly iterate 
			many ideas using both the prototype and physical replicas to fine-tune the game mechanics. Secondly, those that were put on 
			StarCraft II came back with ideas based on StarCraft's asymmetric gameplay to help balance the various heroes while still creating 
			a unique characterization and play-style for each. </div></p>

			<p><div> Further development on the game's user interface began using the principle that the game needed to be both accessible and 
			charming, being able to draw in new players and to be clear how to play the game. Unity is used as the game engine in the interest 
			of speed and to make the game run smoother since the server is where all of the rules exist and calculations happen then the server 
			tells the client what happened Dodds stated that "it's important that you don't have to spend a lot of time understanding the rules to play 
			the game, the depth grows as you go." Gameplay elements such as pre-made decks for each hero, deck building helps, and visual cues 
			on which cards could be played were used to guide new players. Card text was written in a way so that a new player should be 
			able to immediately understand the effects. </div></p>

			<div style= "float : right">
			<img src= "https://external-preview.redd.it/AGYu3bw2uNnhMZ9Ar05rNzf_vwRGJ_rjtZxRY1y3yPM.png?auto=webp&s=ae4a11672776e95fe49a00490f674004bd41f52f" width= "500" height= "350" border="25%"></div>

			<p><div> From the beginning, the game was designed to be played solely online and to mimic the feel of physical cards to make it 
			more accessible to new players. Dodds found that past attempts to digitize physical card games by other companies left areas 
			they felt were lacking, and wanted to improve on that experience. One particular example is card games where players have the ability 
			to react to other players; Dodds noted that when playing in the same room as another player, these types of interactions are 
			straightforward, but consume a great deal of time in a virtual space. Hearthstone was designed to eliminate any gameplay from 
			the opponent during the player's turn, streamlining the game. </div></p>

			<p><div> Other aspects of the game's interface were set to replicate the feel of a physical game being watched by an audience: 
			Hearthstone starts with the player opening a box, during gameplay the cards waver and move while in their hand, and cards when 
			played slam down on the board. When attacking, cards leap across the board to strike the target; when a massive spike of damage 
			is dealt, the board shakes; when a massive creature is summoned, the unseen audience gasps in awe. Hearthstone also offers 
			interactive boards. The boards on which the cards are played can be interacted with in various ways, such as virtually petting a 
			dragon, although the feature is purely for entertainment and has no effect on gameplay. This idea came out from the movie Jumanji 
			in which a board game comes to life, and also mimics how physical card players would often toy with their cards while waiting on 
			their opponent. </div></p>

			<p><div> Unlike physical trading card games, Hearthstone was designed early on without any trading system between players. 
			Hamilton Chu, the executive producer of Hearthstone, stated that "a key thing for us was focusing on [the user]... playing the game", 
			and that trading and market features would dilute this experience. Blizzard wanted to do things such as avoid a free market where 
			card values could fluctuate, discourage cheating methods like bots and duping, reduce the unauthorized third party sales 
			(all against the terms of use), and keep the profit derived from the game for the company. </div></p>

			<p><div> The game's name, Hearthstone, was meant to imply to a close gathering of friends by a hearth, a goal of what they want 
			players to feel. According to Chayes, they had experimented with other constructs of where these card games would take place, 
			and only about halfway through development came onto the idea of using a pub's hearth as the theme; Chayes stated that with that 
			concept, "this is a great way to play, it works with all our values, it has a lot of charm".To maintain a friendly environment around 
			this construct, they added in the ability to trigger one of a few friendly compliments that can be said by a hero, so that players could 
			still emote to their opponent without having to worry about any vitriol </div></p>

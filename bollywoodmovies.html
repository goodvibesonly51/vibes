	<h1 align="center" >WHAT ARE BOLLYWOOD MOVIES?</br></h1>
<font size="+2">The word is often used to describe Indian cinema as a whole, but more precisely it means Hindi language movies only.Bollywood films are also marked by the era of globalization. As economic trade increased throughout the world, more Hindi films were subtitled and dubbed so that non-Indian and non-Hindi speaking audiences could enjoy them. This has led to the widespread commercialization and success of Bollywood films."Bollywood" was probably invented in Bombay-based film trade journals in the 1960s or 1970s, though the exact inventor varies by account. Film journalist Bevinda Collaco claims she coined the term for the title of her column in Screen magazine. Her column entitled "On the Bollywood Beat" covered studio news and celebrity gossip. Other sources state that lyricist, filmmaker and scholar Amit Khanna was its creator.</font>
